title: My first post

My plan for this website is to:

  * Write down things that I find interesting or helpful.
  * Showcase my projects.
  * Experiment with ruby, jekyll and google's amp.

I am currently in a full-stack web-dev program at [galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, so I'm pretty busy, but I'll try to post at least once a week.
