Hello, I'm Dinh and welcome to my website. I am from Madison, Wisconsin but living in Austin, Texas at the moment. I like to take things apart to learn how they work, always curious about my surroundings. I enjoy learning and see it as a continuing process.   

Current favorite activity, reading on my kayak.
